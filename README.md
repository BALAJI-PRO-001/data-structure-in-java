# Data Structure
Data Structure is a branch of Computer Science. The study of data structure allows us to understand the organization of data and the management of the data flow in order to increase the efficiency of any process or program. Data Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in the memory of the computer so that these data can easily be retrieved and efficiently utilized in the future when required. The data can be managed in various ways, like the logical or mathematical model for a specific organization of data is known as a data structure.

## Classification of Data Structures
We can classify Data Structures into two categories:
- Primitive Data Structure
- Non-Primitive Data Structure

**Primitive Data Structures**
- Primitive Data Structures are the data structures consisting of the numbers and the characters that come in-built into programs.
- These data structures can be manipulated or operated directly by machine-level instructions.
- Basic data types like **Integer, Float, Character, and Boolean** come under the Primitive Data Structures.
- These data types are also called Simple data types, as they contain characters that can't be divided further

**Non-Primitive Data Structures**
- Non-Primitive Data Structures are those data structures derived from Primitive Data Structures.
- These data structures can't be manipulated or operated directly by machine-level instructions.
- The focus of these data structures is on forming a set of data elements that is either homogeneous (same data type) or heterogeneous (different data types).
- Based on the structure and arrangement of data, we can divide these data structures into two sub-categories.
  - **Linear Data Structures**
  - **Non-Linear Data Structures**
