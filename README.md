# Data Structure
Data Structure is a branch of Computer Science. The study of data structure allows us to understand the organization of data and the management of the data flow in order to increase the efficiency of any process or program. Data Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in the memory of the computer so that these data can easily be retrieved and efficiently utilized in the future when required. The data can be managed in various ways, like the logical or mathematical model for a specific organization of data is known as a data structure.

## Classification of Data Structures
We can classify Data Structures into two categories:

> - Primitive Data Structure
> - Non-Primitive Data Structure

**Primitive Data Structures**
- Primitive Data Structures are the data structures consisting of the numbers and the characters that come in-built into programs.
- These data structures can be manipulated or operated directly by machine-level instructions.
- Basic data types like **Integer, Float, Character, and Boolean** come under the Primitive Data Structures.
- These data types are also called Simple data types, as they contain characters that can't be divided further

**Non-Primitive Data Structures**
- Non-Primitive Data Structures are those data structures derived from Primitive Data Structures.
- These data structures can't be manipulated or operated directly by machine-level instructions.
- The focus of these data structures is on forming a set of data elements that is either homogeneous (same data type) or heterogeneous (different data types).
- Based on the structure and arrangement of data, we can divide these data structures into two sub-categories.
  - **Linear Data Structures**
  - **Non-Linear Data Structures**

## Linear Data Structures
A data structure that preserves a linear connection among its data elements is known as a Linear Data Structure. 
The arrangement of the data is done linearly, where each element consists of the successors and predecessors except the first and the last data element. However, it is not necessarily true in the case of memory, as the arrangement may not be sequential.

Based on memory allocation, the Linear Data Structures are further classified into two types:

    Static Data Structures: The data structures having a fixed size are known as Static Data Structures. The memory for these data structures is allocated at the compiler time, and their size cannot be changed by the user after being compiled; however, the data stored in them can be altered.
    The Array is the best example of the Static Data Structure as they have a fixed size, and its data can be modified later.
    Dynamic Data Structures: The data structures having a dynamic size are known as Dynamic Data Structures. The memory of these data structures is allocated at the run time, and their size varies during the run time of the code. Moreover, the user can change the size as well as the data elements stored in these data structures at the run time of the code.
    Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues are common examples of dynamic data structures
